# Nicotine_Impact_on_Neurogenesis_snRNAseq
Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of human neural populations to identify neuronal subtypes and developmental trajectories altered by nicotine exposure.  This project combines clustering, differential expression, pathway enrichment (GSEA), and pseudotime analysis to characterize how nicotine reshapes neuronal differentiation and metabolic programs.
